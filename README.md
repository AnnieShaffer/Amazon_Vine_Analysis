# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews for products using data from the Amazon Vine program. I chose the data for the wireless products using the data set found here, https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Wireless_v1_00.tsv.gz

## Summary
Based on the analysis, there does not seem to be a positive bias to leave a positive review if the customer receives a product through the Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine reviews are actually more likely to leave a review that is not 5 stars based on this analysis.

We could continue this analysis and look at the distribution of reviews for each group. From there, we could analyze if the Amazon Vine customers are more likely to leave a negative review or if they're reviews are more likely to have a normal distribution.
